# Icon set

The icons included with the template were designed by Kristian Hentschel for this project and may be considered to be in the public domain.

The Sketch project file contains the original vectors. All available icons can be seen in `src/components/icon/demo.html`.

The icon font is created from the SVG vectors exported from Sketch (one file per artboard) with [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/app/). When updating the icons, create a new font and replace the corresponding files in `src/components/icon/`. 

The _IcoMoon_ settings used were:

 * Font name `bbcat-icon`
 * Class Prefix `bbcat-icon-` (no class suffix)
 * Support IE8 `yes`
 * Include metadata in fonts `yes`
 * Generate preprocessor variables for `Sass`
 * CSS Selector `use a class`
 * Font metrics `1024/6.25/50`
