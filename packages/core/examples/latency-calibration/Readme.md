# Players example

This example shows how device output latency may be compensated for, by lining up WebAudio beeps, noise bursts, or an orchestration sequence. Note that no session is created, instead the wall clock is used directly with an infinitely looping sequence.

## Usage

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

After running the development server (`npm run dev`), browse to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
