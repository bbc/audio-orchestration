# generate-sequence

Takes the MDO Metadata table, and the data generated by [split-track](../split-tracks), and
produces an intermediate sequence `.json` file.

Take the output of this script and use it with [encode-media](../encode-media) to replace the
original file names in it with actual media URLs.
