# bbcat-orchestration-cloud-sync-client

This is a fork of the [2-IMMERSE/cloud-sync](https://github.com/2-IMMERSE/cloud-sync). The following changes will be made in this branch:

* remove server-side dependencies to simplify consuming the client as a Node.js dependency,
* apply a small number of patches to provide functionality required for audio orchestration projects,
* and publish the built client library to a private NPM repository hosted in R&D Artifactory.

# Cloud-Sync Media Synchronisation Service 

<img src="https://2immerse.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2-IMM_150x50.png" align="left"/><em>This project was originally developed as part of the <a href="https://2immerse.eu/">2-IMMERSE</a> project, co-funded by the European Commissionâ€™s <a hef="http://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/">Horizon 2020</a> Research Programme</em>

## Overview

**An implementation of a Media Synchronisation Service and its client library (intended for use in the browser).**

Cloud-Sync is a frame-accurate inter-destination media synchronisation service that supports a number of timing control schemes and asynchrony reduction algorithms:
1. Synchronisation Master (or Maestro)
2. Distributed (no master)
3. Latest Master (Last node to change timeline is Master)

It is compatible with DVB-CSS in that it uses the notion of timelines to model the progress of media presentation and uses a time synchronisation scheme (CSS-WC) and timeline correlations to export timeline progress estimates.

It allows a client to register a timing source and for other clients  to discover that timing source, and use it as a **synchronisation timeline** for time-aligning the presentation of their own media objects.

Cloud-Sync provides a registered timing source to a client (upon request) via a Timeline Shadow. This is a local estimate of the timeline on the client device and is manifested by the cloud-sync client API as a software clock  object. 

Cloud-Sync supports the following features:
* LAN-local interdevice and inter-destination media synchronisation with frame synchronisation accuracy  
* *Synchronisation Maestro*, *Distributed*, *Latest Master* timing control schemes
* A lightweight time synchronisation scheme that can run in browser environments
* Dynamic master node election
* Dynamic sync error monitoring and alerts
* Arbitratry timing sources (e.g. media players,  artificial clocks, broadcast timelines)
* Sync protocols over multiple transports: WebSockets, UDP, TCP 
* Client Sync-Controllers for local media playback adaptation

The documentation for the API and usage instructions for the client library can be found in [client-api.md](client-api.md)


## Cloud-Sync Service Endpoints

The Cloud-Sync service exposes 2 endpoints:
1. a **Wallclock-Service endpoint** (UDP or WebSocket) for time-synchronisation (via the CSS-WC protocol), and
2. a **Synchronisation-Service endpoint** (MQTT over WebSocket) for registering clients, registering timelines, responding to timeline queries and advertising synchronisation timelines.

These endpoint are:
* WallClock-Service WebSocket endpoint: `ws://<SERVER_IP>:6676`
* WallClock-Service UDP endpoint: `udp://<SERVER_IP>:6677`
* Sync-Service WebSocket endpoint:  `ws://<SERVER_IP>:9001`

## Getting started

### 1. Clone the repository and install dependencies

First download and then install dependencies:

    $ cd cloudsync
    $ npm install

Note that NPM install might fail if NPM is not able to access your credentials for the
project repository.


### 2. EITHER: Build the client library for the browser

If you wish to build it into a single JS file suitable for the browser (i.e.
for including in a webpage) then do this:

    $ grunt

The resulting JS client library is placed in `dist/browser/Cloud-SyncKit.js`.

**Usage instructions for the client library can be found in [client-api.md](client-api.md)**  

### OR: build the synchronisation service and run it on a server machine or cloud platform

1. Make sure ***docker*** and ***docker-compose*** are installed:
    
    *docker-compose* installation instructions are available here: `https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/`


2. Edit `docker-compose.yml` to change the WallClock service endpoint advertised to the cloud-sync service clients.

     Change the `WALLCLOCK_SERVICE_WS_URL` field values in `docker-compose.yml` to point to the correct endpoint for the WallClock service. The WallClock-Service websocket endpoint is exposed at `ws://<YOUR_MACHINE_IP>:6676`.

     You can change the port mappings from the containerised services to your host device here, if you have port collisions.
  
3. Build microservice images and instantiate containers using the **docker-compose** tool.

    The `docker-compose.yml` YAML file specifies the microservices in the cloud-sync service:
    1. WallClock service
    2. SessionController service
    3. SyncController service
    4. Redis
    5. Mosquitto (MQTT broker)
    6. TimelineObserver service
    7. Consul
    8. Registrator


  Run the following script:

    $ ./start_service.sh

4. Check that your containers have started successfully and are discoverable:

    Open the web UI at this URL in your browser: `http://<YOUR_MACHINE_IP>:8500/`
   

5. Check if the sync service is working by loading this demo app on a browser: `http://<YOUR_MACHINE_IP>:3000?video=https://download.blender.org/durian/trailer/sintel_trailer-720p.mp4`

   1. Enter a session id value e.g. `123`

   2. Select the 'Dynamic' synchronisation option to allow any client to change the timeline position
  
   3. Wait for video to start playing.
    
        If video does not start playing, check if these config settings are correct: 
        - the `WALLCLOCK_SERVICE_WS_URL` fields in `docker-compose.yml` are set to point to the correct WallClock service endpoint
        - the client config file `examples/synchronisedvideo/config/config.js` contains teh correct URL for the Sync-Service endpoint.
  
   4. Open another client.  When the video starts to play, click on the **share** button on the video scrubber to
     - start another instance of the demo app in another window
     - obtain a QR code to open a client on an Android phone

       Alternatively, make another client join the sync session by opening the above URL and specifying the same `session id ` and `sync-timeline-election algorithm` options.
