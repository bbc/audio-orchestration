# bbcat-orchestration-bbcat-js

This repository is a fork of [bbcat-js](https://github.com/bbc/bbcat-js) library with many features and dependencies removed and orchestration-specific patches applied. You'll most likely want the original instead.

All modules but `core` and `dash` have been removed to create a minimal build of the library.
